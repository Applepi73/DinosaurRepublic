						<h3>Hi!</h3>
						<p>My name is <b>Malwina Piątkowska</b>. I’m 14 years old and I like dinosaurs. I also like programming in Python and C++. I can play the piano and that’s why I like digits – everything in music is dividable by 2! </p>
						<p>One of my multiple talents is translating decimal to binary, octal and hexadecimal code. In my free time, I like to play <a id="link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.petraapps.binarygame&hl=en&gl=US" target="_blank">Binary Fun</a>. It’s a game in which you need to convert decimal to binary, octal or hexadecimal. You are competing with yourself – the faster you convert, the better you are! </p>
						<p>Another thing I enjoy is rollerskating, cycling in the forest and diving. In the future, I want to live in the forest so I can get rest from other people. When I was 10 I made my first app – it was very simple. When you clicked the background, its colour changed. I was proud of myself at the time. </p>

						<h3>How did I get the idea of Dinosaur Republic?</h3>
						<p>Do you know the <b>Peppa Pig</b> series? And do you know George? Yeah. He inspired me with dinosaurs. I appreciate how he is in love with his dinosaur. </p>
						<p>So one day I thought ‘I like making websites – why not make one that has some content?’. It turned out that my knowledge about the graphic side of a website was small. After I discovered <b>CSS</b>, it got easier. You should check out making a website, it's fun!</p>
