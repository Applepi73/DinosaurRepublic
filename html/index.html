				<h3>Dinosaurs - what are they?</h3>
				<p>
					Dinosaurs were spectacular reptiles which ruled Earth for more than 150 million years. Dinosaurs didn’t have a specific diet. Some of them were herbivores and some were meat-eaters. Some of them were as big as a chicken but others were giants – being 50 meters in height is impressive!
				</p>
				<p>
					The word <i>dinosaur</i> comes from Greek words <i>deinos</i> - terrible and <i>sauros</i> - lizard.

			<h3>Why and when did dinosaurs disappear?</h3>
			<div class="container">
					<p>
						Dinosaurs first appeared around 240 million years ago. They became the dominant terrestrial animals after the Triassic-Jurassic event 201 million years ago. Dinosaurs went extinct <b>about 65 million years ago</b>, after living on Earth for about 165 million years. <br><br><br>
						Dinosaurs became extinct because of an <b>asteroid</b> - a large, rocky thing that orbits the Sun. Any fragment of an asteroid that survives landing on Earth becomes known as a meteorite. The asteroid that killed the dinosaurs was around 10 to 15 wide, but it created a much larger crater, <b>150 kilometres</b> in diameter.
