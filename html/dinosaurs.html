				<h2>Dinosaurs' types</h2>

					<span>
						<h3>Theropods</h3>
						Theropod dinosaurs were mostly meat-eaters. Some of their features are short arms and long legs. They were also bipedal. They first appeared in the late Triassic period and were present all the way up to the moment when an asteroid killed the dinosaurs.
					</span>
				</div>
				<p>
					<h4>Giganotosaurus</h4>
					<div class="container">
						By the name of this species we know it was large. It was one of the biggest known terrestrial carnivores. It had the body length of 12 to 13 meters, skull length of 1,5 to 1,8 meters and weight 4,2 to 13,8 ton. It was also pretty fast – maximum speed of 50 km/h! <br><br>
						
						The Giganotosaurus’s skeleton was discovered in Argentina in 1993. The skeleton is now housed in Ernesto Bachmann Paleontological Museum in Argentina. <img src="gigantosaurus_skeleton.jpg">
					</div>
				</p>
				<p>
					<h4>Tyrannosaurus</h4>
					<div class="container">
						Like Giganotosaurus, Tyrannosaurus was also a large species. It is sometimes called T-rex. It had a massive skull which was balanced by a long and heavy tail. It had extremely powerful limbs, so it could carry its weight – 8,4 to 14 ton. It gained food by biting them with its 18-centimetre teeth. If you raced against it while riding a bike, it still would be faster than you – it ran with a speed of 32 kilometres per hour! <img src="tyranosaurus_skeleton.jpg">
					</div></p>
					<p>It is one of the most used dinosaurs in pop culture, we can find it among others in movies, ads, and many other media. The first parts of Tyrannosaurus found were teeth in 1874 in Colorado. 
				</p>
				<p>
					<h4>Velociraptor</h4>
					<div class="container">
						You may think all Theropod dinosaurs were big. If you do, you’re wrong! The Velociraptor was only 1 meter in height, 1,7 meters in length and it weighed 20 kg. We can say it was as big as a turkey. Despite its size, it was a great warrior. It had feathers on its whole body. <br><br>
						It was first discovered in Mongolia. <img src="velociraptor_skeleton.jpg">

				<div class="container_n">
					<img src="sauropod.png">
					<span>
						<h3>Sauropods</h3>
						The group of Sauropods includes the largest animals to have ever lived on land. They had very long necks and tails, small heads and 4 legs. All Sauropods were herbivores. The name <i>Sauropod</i> comes from Ancient Greek and means <i>lizard foot</i>. They became widespread about 150 million years ago, in the Late Jurassic era. Their remains have been found on every continent, including Antarctica. 
					</span>
				</div>
				<p>
					<h4>Diplodocus</h4>
					<div class="container">
						Its fossils were first discovered in 1877. They lived in the area of today’s North America and tended to be the size of 4 elephants! They were 29 to 32 meters long and weighed 113 tons. Its enormously long tail was balancing the body and was a great defence technique. An interesting fact is – its skin was similar to an iguana’s. It had narrow and pointed spines that could be up to 18 centimetres. <img src="diplodocus_skeleton.jpg">
					</div>
				</p>
				<p>
					<h4>Brachiosaurus</h4>
					<div class="container">
						The name of this species comes from Ancient Greek and means ‘arm lizard’. It was first discovered in 1900 in Colorado. Brachiosaurus was probably 18 to 21 meters long and it weighed 28 to 58 tons. Atypically, it had a longer neck and shorter tail. We know it consumed daily 200 to 400 kilograms of plants, which were its food. Brachiosaurus is also the first dinosaur shown in Jurassic Park! <img src="brachiosaurus_skeleton.jpg">
					</div>
				</p>
				<p>
					<h4>Apatosaurus</h4>
					<div class="container">
						Apatosauruses lived in North America during the Late Jurassic period. The name means ‘deceptive lizard’. It was first described in 1877. It had a length of 21-23 meters and an average mass of 32 to 72 tons.<br><br>Trackways show that they may have had a range of around 15 to 40 kilometres per day. <img src="apatosaurus_skeleton.jpg">

					<img src="stegosaur.png">
					<span>
						<h3>Stegosaurs</h3>
						Stegosauruses were herbivores, they had 4 legs and were armoured. The name means <i>roof -lizard</i>. They were from the Late Jurassic. One of their features is kite-shaped upright plates along their backs and spikes on their tails, which are called osteoderms. 
					</span>
				</div>
				<p>
					<h4>Kentrosaurus</h4>
					<div class="container">
						Kentrosaurus is a stegosaurid dinosaur that lived in the Late Jurassic period in Tanzania. It was first described in 1915. ‘Kentosaurus’ means ‘pointed-tail lizard’. We can see why it was named like that in the picture on the right. It was a herbivore, mostly eating barely chewed chunks.<br><br>
						Kentrosaur was a small stegosaur. It had a length of 4,5 to 5,5 meters, half of its length being the tail. It weighed about 1-1,5 tonnes, depending on the tail. Its spikes could have up to 73 centimetres in height!  <img src="kentrosaurus_skeleton.jpg">
